It introduces object-oriented writing in Script! Scheme to create and use this object is the same for each typu. <br>
<br>
At the start we need to create/define object:
<pre style="code-text"># General definition
new [Type of Object] [ID];

# Examples
new Region "Cuboid";
new Inventory "&bInventory Name"
new Recpie "Panda";</pre><i style="font-size: 65%">Example creating items. If you forget to create a generally Wildskript should automatically create object, but his earlier definition is clearer. In particular recommended for beginners, because it allows to better understand the operation of objects.</i></p>
After you have created, our object is:
<pre style="code-text"># General definition
[Object] = [ID].[Type of Object]

# Examples
"Cuboid".Region
"&bInventory Name".Inventory
"Panda".Recipe</pre>
<br>
At our object, you can you can perform many operations. All possible actions that can be performed on the object are described in the bookmark specific object.
<br><br>
General scheme:
<pre style="code-text">
# General definition
[Object].[Action]{[Arguments]};

# Examples
"Cuboid".Region.selectLL{{_location.1}, {_location.2}};
"&bInventory Name".Inventory.setItem{1, diamond named "&6Click me"};
"Panda".Recipe.setResult{sugar cane named "&aBamboo"};</pre><i style="font-size: 65%">In a similar way we write expression and conditions.</i>
